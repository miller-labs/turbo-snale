This is a programme to simulate the response of a radio interferometer. It takes two point 
sources (stars) as it's input and outputs an image of the stars, as seen by the interferometer. 
The point sources are defined in the POINT_SOURCE.txt file. 
Coordinates of the sources are given, along with their flux (brightness).
