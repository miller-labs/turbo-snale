This is a programme to simulate the response of a radio interferometer. It takes two point 
sources (stars) as its input and outputs an image of the stars, as seen by the interferometer. 
The point sources are defined in the POINT_SOURCE.txt file. 
Coordinates of the sources are given, along with their flux (brightness).
The configuration of the telescope is given in the text file, d_config.txt. The file gives the relative positions of the antennas measured by the time it takes light to travel between them.
